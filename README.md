Custom Map Markers
===

Shift + Left click on the local map to add your own custom map markers.  These custom markers are saved across quits.  They do not touch your game saves but are instead saved in the custom-map-markers.bin file in the same folder as your saves and screenshots.

Installation

1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) and point it at your Pathfinder: Kingmaker game directory (if using Steam, this will typically be at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathfinder Kingmaker\`)
2. Use UMM to install the mod by dragging and dropping the zip file into its Mods tab.

Unistallation
----
1. Use UMM to uninstall the mod.  Or delete the mod from the Pathfinder Kingmaker\Mods directory.

Credits
----
Big debt to [Eldritch Arcana](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/79), an excellent mod by Elmindra / [jennyem](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods) for both code and the initial bootstrap into modding this game.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26) was useful both in testing and for some of the menu code.

[Turn-Based Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/109?tab=description) is the reason I bought this game.
