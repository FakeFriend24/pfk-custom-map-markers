Credits
----
Big debt to [Eldritch Arcana](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/79), an excellent mod by Elmindra / [jennyem](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods) for both code and the initial bootstrap into modding this game.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26) was useful both in testing and for some of the menu code.

[Turn-Based Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/109?tab=description) is the reason I bought this game.
